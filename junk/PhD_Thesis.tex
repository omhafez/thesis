\subsection{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}
\label{Magnetic Resonance Imaging}

MRI is ideal for visually distinguishing soft tissues, but objects MUST contain hydrogen molecules (e.g. water). However it is possible to get around this problem and scan “dry” objects made of plastic, for example, by immersing them in jelly. The negative of the object is then visible in the MRI data. Segmentation can be threshold based in some cases. Unfortunately it is quite common for different objects to be easily distinguishable visually, by texture, but not by greyscale. In these cases some level of manual segmentation may be required. MRI images often suffer from signal attenuation and/or noise on the borders of the region of interest.

Simpleware webinar

- simpleware does not do CAD-based modeling, goes directly to the mesh
- contact regarding technical work/papers for meshing
export as STL, mesh, or NURBS
- TWO BOTTLENECKS
  - image segmentation time
  - generating watertight and error free meshes
    - no gaps or overlaps 
    - no inverted elements 
    - no negative jacobian
- segmentation -> stl -> smoothing -> nurbs -> meshing -  cad geometry medical device -> export final model -> poor elements, gaps and overlap, non convergence, not watertight
- manual corrections of stl, curbs, meshes

- generation of watertight STL
- aspect ratio/mesh quality
- image-based meshing

- BLENDR - graphics, STL
- Rhino - STL generation, NURBS
