Questions to ask with available model
Effect of smoothing/trabeculae
Do trabeculae affect the solution
How sensitive are the results from paraview smoothing?
Effect of resolution – make multiple meshes of same geometry
Number of iterations – do they depend on mesh resolution? Would like it not to 
Does V cycle work for my geometry?
Fiber generation vs fibers from raw data + interp + smoothing
Verification/validation
Stress/strain plots
Initial cycle is faster than others: first frame but also first cycle all together is faster
Mesh quality/aspect ratio
Potential plots:	
Volumetric strain
Deviatoric strain
C11, c22, c33
Maximal principal eigenvalue
C11 from fiber orientation
Hysteresis plot of position

structure/trabeculae
fibergen vs DTI
Jeremy drug studies, a lot didn’t match
whole range of sensitivity studies
