\textit{Image-based modeling and simulation}, also known as \textit{patient-specific modeling and simulation} or \textit{in-silico modeling and simulation}, is the process of performing mathematical computations based on imaging data to analyze and predict the physical behavior of biological tissues. Imaging data directly provides the geometry and/or material properties of the biological structures of interest, in contrast to conventional engineering disciplines where the geometry and materials of a device or structure originate from man-made designs. Historically, studies of biological tissues or organisms have been limited to either \textit{in vivo} (``within the living'') experimentation or \textit{ex vivo} (``outside of the living'') experimentation. \textit{In vivo} studies raise ethical concerns about experimenting on live subjects (human or otherwise), can be costly, and conditions are inherently difficult to control. \textit{Ex vivo} studies, on the other hand, can never truly represent how an organism behaves after it has been removed from its native environment. \textit{In silico} (``in silicon'') studies provide the ability to model \textit(in vivo) behavior without the same concerns of ethics or cost, and with more control of desired detail than what \textit{ex vivo} affords~\cite{colquitt_2011}. That control allows \textit{in silico} approaches to be used in conjunction with \textit{in vivo} and \textit{ex vivo} to advance the medical sciences in a number of exciting ways.

Image-based modeling and simulation covers a broad spectrum of fields, including image processing, computational geometry, numerical methods, and biomechanics. The workflow entails: medical imaging and image segmentation, image-based mesh generation, physics-based modeling and simulation, and medical application. Each of these steps are described in turn.

\chapref{2} describes the basic physics involved in acquiring medical images for a number of imaging modalities. Medical images will be assumed here to be three-dimensional rectilinear grids of \textit{voxels}, or 3D pixels. The chapter also presents a review of state-of-the-art image segmentation techniques, which demarcate the voxels in an image into the various objects and tissues of interest.

The topic of image-based mesh generation is discussed in \chapref{3}, which involves using segmented images to generate  geometrical meshes suitable for simulation. Image-based meshing is often separated into two steps: first surface generation,  followed by conventional CAD-based volume meshing. A novel Voronoi-based surface generation technique is presented, and a brief review of CAD-based meshing techniques are covered. A novel image-based meshing tool is introduced, that makes important improvements to the speed and robustness of generating meshes from image data.

The next step in the workflow - physics-based modeling and simulation - may refer to a number of different physical phenomena and numerical methods. \chapref{4} presents pertinent theory and implementation specific to modeling nonlinear solid mechanics using finite element methods. Continuum mechanics and finite element method principles are discussed, as well as a particular flavor of polyhedral finite elements. An implementation of incremental kinematics within finite element codes is presented, and the use of hyperelastic materials in an incremental kinematics framework is demonstrated.

\chapref{5} covers the use of image-based modeling and simulation in the field of cardiac mechanics. The important numerical considerations in performing human heart modeling are discussed. Contributions made to an existing cardiac mechanics code are highlighted, and simulation results using that code are shown. 

Future work is discussed on several fronts in \chapref{6}. Progress toward demonstrating polyhedral finite element methods as a viable option in image-based modeling and simulation is presented. Potential improvements to the image-based meshing code as well as the cardiac mechanics code are listed. Broader topics in the future of image-based modeling and simulation are also mentioned, specifically how it is playing a role in the simulation of clinical trials and in applications in rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing. A continuing project is discussed that uses machine learning in conjunction with the the novel image-based meshing tool introduced in \chapref{3}.

Lastly, concluding remarks are given in \chapref{7}.
