Simpleware webinar

- simpleware does not do CAD-based modeling, goes directly to the mesh
- contact regarding technical work/papers for meshing
export as STL, mesh, or NURBS
- TWO BOTTLENECKS
  - image segmentation time
  - generating watertight and error free meshes
    - no gaps or overlaps 
    - no inverted elements 
    - no negative jacobian
- segmentation -> stl -> smoothing -> nurbs -> meshing -  cad geometry medical device -> export final model -> poor elements, gaps and overlap, non convergence, not watertight
- manual corrections of stl, curbs, meshes

- generation of watertight STL
- aspect ratio/mesh quality
- image-based meshing

- BLENDR - graphics, STL
- Rhino - STL generation, NURBS
