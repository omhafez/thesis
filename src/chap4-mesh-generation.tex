Simpleware webinar

- simpleware does not do CAD-based modeling, goes directly to the mesh
- contact regarding technical work/papers for meshing
export as STL, mesh, or NURBS
- TWO BOTTLENECKS
  - image segmentation time
  - generating watertight and error free meshes
    - no gaps or overlaps 
    - no inverted elements 
    - no negative jacobian
- segmentation -> stl -> smoothing -> nurbs -> meshing -  cad geometry medical device -> export final model -> poor elements, gaps and overlap, non convergence, not watertight
- manual corrections of stl, curbs, meshes

- generation of watertight STL
- aspect ratio/mesh quality
- image-based meshing

- BLENDR - graphics, STL
- Rhino - STL generation, NURBS

Simpleware paper:
1. marching cubes for surface mesh
2. Advancing front or Delaunay techniques for tet meshing --> produces slivers though
3. Extended EVoMacs

hex meshers:

truegrid\\
cubit

mask to mesh:
dual contouring

"state of the art" papers\\
Sculpt Sandia - grid based meshing, volume fraction \\
"Parallel hex meshing from volume fractions"\\
For each voxel, sample a bunch of points, decide if inside or outside \\
Look at neighboring cells, do least squares to approximate gradient and throw down normal \\
