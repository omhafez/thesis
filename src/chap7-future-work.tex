dental applications - 1) for implant placement and crown design, 2) for 3D printing, aesthetic try-in 

tolerance-aware voronoi-partitioning \\
multiple material interfaces (see paper) \\

Abaqus: ability to deal with initial over-closures? A strain-free adjustment perhaps? Like if you were to mesh the femur and the femoral cartilage separately, say, and there is a tiny bit of overlap between them..are you able to fix this without going back to the meshing software?
