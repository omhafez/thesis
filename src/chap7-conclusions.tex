This work has presented a new image-based modeling and simulation pipeline. The workflow includes a novel algorithm for generating b-reps from binary image masks. The algorithm first generates a dense oriented point cloud that approximates the surface of the object by minimizing a relative error functional. This error measures the difference in geometric properties between the voxelated image mask and the approximated surface. The point cloud generation step is highly parallelizable since the calculation of each point is independent of one another. A Voronoi-based surface reconstruction algorithm was presented, that inserts Voronoi sites based on the point cloud, computes a Voronoi partition, and extracts the surface based on material assignments of the Voronoi sites. The surface generation algorithm performs well for surfaces that do not have regions of excessively high curvature or sharp features. The surface is subsequently cleaned and decimated to produce a watertight, manifold surface mesh that may be used as input to CAD-based meshing software, 3D printers, or visualization programs. The code was linked with third-party image segmentation and CAD-based meshing software, and packaged into a free, open-source tool named Shabaka. It is available on Github for Linux, Mac, and Windows. The tool installs in a matter of 15 minutes, and meshes can be generated typically in less than 5 minutes on a personal computer. Dozens of example meshes were created to demonstrate the code's capability.

The surface mesh of a human heart was generated utilizing the tools described, and used as input to automatically produce quadratic tetrahedral and polyhedral meshes of the heart ventricles for the purposes of finite element analysis. Cardiac mechanics simulations were performed on massively parallel systems within the code Cardioid to model the mechanical behavior of a beating heart. Conventional finite element techniques were applied to a quadratic tet mesh. In the process, existing tools to model muscle fiber orientations, simulate the electrophysiology, and assign boundary conditions were streamlined for expedient results. The fiber orientations, activation times, boundary condition tags, and pressure boundary conditions were imported into the polyhedral code Celeris for the purposes of running the same simulation using polyhedral FEM. Polyhedral finite elements offer the promise of a robust and automated workflow while potentially significantly reducing the system size compared to conventional FEM. That reduction is mainly achieved because the simulation resolution is completely independent of the geometric resolution. The material model incorporated the cardiac simulations was implemented in the polyhedral code and verified against a suite of test problems. Additional steps will complete the verification of the polyhedral implementation, demonstrate capability of polyhedral FEM in cardiac mechanics, and showcase the ability to produce accurate results with fewer degrees of freedom. The work has shown promising preliminary results in demonstrating PFEM as an alternative to conventional approaches in modeling cardiac mechanics and biomechanics problems in general.

The image-based modeling and simulation workflow is to be used in a project that performs cardiac simulations in conjunction with machine learning techniques to improve procedures treating cardiac arrhythmia. Provided that the role of patent-specific material parameters and patient-specific boundary conditions are better understood, and that models begin to incorporate more rigorous validation and uncertainty quantification techniques, \textit{in silico} modeling has the potential to significantly impact the medical field. Simulation of clinical trials, optimization of surgical techniques and medical device designs, and additive manufacturing are among the most compelling and impactful areas that are benefiting from this technology.
